This was my first big independant project which I began work on a month or so after writing my very first "Hello World". There are likely some bugs and the documentation is certainly not up to my current standards. If you want to revise any bugs or add notes please feel free. The game is fully text/ASCII based and is meant to be enjoyed using the terminal window.


GAMEPLAY TIPS:
- The doors can be opened in any order but one should know that difficulty increases with higher numbers.
- You must equip newly aquired items between rooms


Future Goals:

[ ] create endgame/final boss

[ ] write a system for loading and saving character info from csv

[ ] write a reset function to clear csv back to start

[ ] write more specific battle intro and outros

[ ] write a manual with weapon/monster details
