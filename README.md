# PYTHON-RPG
Multi-Level dungeon crawler with turn-based combat, equipment system, level ups, minigames, and more. (Work in Progress)

This was my first big independant project which I began work on a month or so after writing my very first "Hello World". There are likely some bugs and the documentation is certainly not up to my current standards. The game is fully text/ASCII based and is meant to be enjoyed using the terminal window.


GAMEPLAY TIP:
The doors can be opened in any order but one should know that difficulty increases with higher numbers.

Needs work
[x] seperate classes into different .py files

[] add more detailed documentation

[] create endgame

Future Goals

[] write a system for loading and saving character info from csv

[] write a reset function to clear csv back to start

[] write more specific battle intro and outros

[x] = completed
